ROB5 - the final todolist: 

Part 1: 
Add introduction.
Simplify explanation of offline planning. (maybe using a flow diagram?)
Could we do a small showing how the robot moves, 
  kinda like the one under door detection?
Write a conclusion. (maybe merge with results) 
  
Part 2: 
Needs an introduction and conclusion

Part 3: 
Needs explanation of the internal matching between 
  detected features and features in the map.
Also needs some results, intro and conclusion.


All code should be done at this point.
