First meeting:
Attendants: Mikkel, Nikolaj, Mikael
Summary:
	- We need a time schedule.
		- Initially, everyone looks into part1: Planning

	- Wavefront algorithm is used to find shortest path to offloading station.
		- Find the best Wavefront algorithm we've made.
		- It should be easy: In init phase, a wavefront is made for the two offloading stations.
		  Then the robot should always be able to give a (x,y)
		  and instantly ( in O(1) ) know which pixel to move to next.
		  
	- Configuration space: Padding of obstacles (walls) by 4 pixels (only pad freespace!)
		- The robot starts by creating the configuration space,
		  so it can be reduced to a point robot!

	- Look into Coverage algorithms in the book.
