First meeting:
Attendants: Mikkel, Nikolaj, Mikael
Summary:
	- We need a time schedule.
		- Initially, everyone looks into part1: Planning
	- Wavefront algorithm is used to find shortest path to offloading station.
		- Find the best Wavefront algorithm we've made.
	- Configuration space: Padding of obstacles (walls) by 4 pixels (only pad freespace!)
		- The robot starts by creating the configuration space,
		so it can be reduced to a point robot!

	- Look into "Coverage" algorithms in the book.
