\subsection{Conclusion}
The sweeping of the floor takes 16 hours and 7 minutes.
If one man-hour costs 28 EUR, the robot is replacing 451.27 EUR of human labour
with every sweeping.
Thus, if this was the robots only task, it would take 177 sweeps for the robot to save its price of 80000 EUR.

Assuming the robot collects cups and sweeps the floor every day
(somehow managing to only pause for 31 minutes a day),
it would take 122 days before the robot had earned home its price.
That's a bargain!
