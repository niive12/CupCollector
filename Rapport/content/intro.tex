This paper describes our solution for The Cup Collector project, and has been devised for the course Robots in Context. The goal is to implement 3 different parts of a robot system for picking up cups all over SDU-TEK. 

In part 1, a method to scan all rooms and pick up cups is implemented. The route is planned off-line using a map (image) of the facility. 

In part 2, the functionality of the robot is expanded to also include sweeping the floors. 

For part 3, a method for localizing the robot is necessary. The used hardware is described and two methods of localisation is implemented and compared.
