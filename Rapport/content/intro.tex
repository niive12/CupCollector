\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}
This paper describes a solution for The Cup Collector project,
and has been devised for the course Robots in Context.
The goal is to implement 3 different parts of a robot system for picking up cups all over SDU-TEK. 

In part 1, a method to scan all rooms and pick up cups is implemented.
The route is planned offline using a map (image) of the facility. 

In part 2, a floor sweeping mode is implemented in the robot.
In this mode, the robot sweeps the floor of SDU-TEK.  

For part 3, a method for localizing the robot is necessary.
The used hardware is described and two methods of localisation are implemented and compared.
