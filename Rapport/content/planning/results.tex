\subsection{Results}
The robot scans the entire freespace, detecting all 287 cups.
All cups are picked up and returned to the offloading stations.
The total traveled path length is 37294 m, corresponding to a travel time of 7 hours and 28 minutes.

% Figure \ref{cup_collection_results} shows part of the offline generated map vs. the traveled path in the same part of the map.

The offline processing taking place before the robot begins its movement takes
