\subsection{Future work}
\label{sec:planning_future}
It is likely that the generated set of coordinates, \(S_{M}\), that the robot must scan,
is not optimally generated. Future work could look into alternatives to the coverage method used here.
For example, it might be logical to make the robot stick to areas such as hallways until all the cups
in those areas are collected. This way, the robot wouldn't have to return to the same hallway as many times.

The robot movement solves a Traveling Salesman Problem suboptimally, using the nearest-neighbour strategy.
This strategy is used because of it's computational efficiency. However, if more computational power
is available, another, more optimal, strategy may be applied to solving the problem better.
