\subsection{Conclusion}
Two offline localisation methods were implemeted on a PC:
One based on odometry alone, and one based on laser range scanner line feature extraction alone.

A UMBmark test showed that the line-based method worked better in practice, as it did not accumulate errors over time.
The line-based localisation method was able to accurately determine the robot position and orientation.
