\subsection{Future work}
Future work should focus on online implementations of the algorithms.
This would allow the robot to actually use its position and orientation in planning its movements.

The localisation algorithm has much room for improvement. The first step would be to
include odometry readings in the calculation of the next step. One simple way of expanding
the algorithm is to use odometry only if the laser range data are not present or sufficient to update the robot state.

As both odometry and laser range scanner readings were collected,
the optimal localisation method should combine them using a Kalman filter.
Here, it would be beneficial to include the robots linear and angular velocities/accelerations
to predict the robots movement.
